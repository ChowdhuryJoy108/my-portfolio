        <span className="text-3xl text-green-400 font-bold">Hello!</span> I'm a passionate web developer with a strong foundation in
        MERN stack technology. I graduated from IIUC and successfully completed
        my full-stack development course on Programming Hero.
        <br />
        <br />
        My journey in programming started with a deep curiosity about how the
        web works, which soon turned into a full-fledged passion for building
        dynamic and interactive web applications. I enjoy creating modern,
        scalable, and efficient web solutions that solve real-world problems.
        <br />
        <br />
        Beyond coding, I have a keen interest in sports, exploring new tech
        trends, and dabbling in creative pursuits like graphic design. I
        believe in continuous learning and pushing my limits to grow as a
        developer and as a person. If you're looking for someone who is
        enthusiastic, dedicated, and always up for a challenge, let's connect! ðŸš€
