          a passionate web developer with a strong foundation in MERN stack
          technology. I graduated from IIUC and successfully completed my
          full-stack development course on Programming Hero. My journey in
          programming started with a deep curiosity about how the web works,
          which soon turned into a full-fledged passion for building dynamic and
          interactive web applications. I enjoy creating modern, scalable, and
          efficient web solutions that solve real-world problems. Whether it's
          developing a sleek front-end UI with React or architecting a robust
          back-end with Node.js and Express, I love bringing ideas to life
          through code. Outside of programming, I have a keen interest in sports
          and enjoy staying active. I also like exploring new tech trends,
          learning about emerging frameworks, and occasionally dabbling in
          creative pursuits like graphic design. I believe in continuous
          learning and pushing my limits, always striving to improve as a
          developer and as a person. If you're looking for someone who is
          enthusiastic, dedicated, and always up for a challenge, let's connect!
